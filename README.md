# Scratchpad

Generic scratchpad web app

Idea is for basically a more advanced pastebin. 
You should be able to type into a scratchpad, and then generate a link to share it. 
When you do this, the note should go read-only except for you, who should still be able to edit it. 

User accounts should be optional. 
If the user is not logged in with an account, they should be tracked using a simple cookie, to associate them with their notes. 
However, if they clear their cookies they will lose access to their notes. 

Notes should last a long time but not forever (unless you are a paying member?). 
In general this is more of a generic tool vs. pastebin which markets themselves as programmer-oriented.
