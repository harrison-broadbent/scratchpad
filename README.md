# Scratchpad

Generic scratchpad web app

Idea is for basically a more advanced pastebin. 
You should be able to type into a scratchpad, and then generate a link to share it. 
When you do this, the note should go read-only except for you, who should still be able to edit it. 

User accounts should be optional.
